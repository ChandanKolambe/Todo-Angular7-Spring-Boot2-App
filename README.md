# Todo App Angular7 SpringBoot2

A **Basic Todo Management Application** using Angular, Spring Boot and Spring Security Frameworks.

We will be using **Angular** (Frontend Framework), **TypeScript Basics, Angular Cli**(To create Angular projects), **Spring Boot** (REST API Framework), **Spring** (Dependency Management),  **Spring Security** (Authentication and Authorization - Basic and JWT),**BootStrap** (Styling Pages), **Maven** (dependencies management), **Node** (npm), **H2 Database, Visual Studio Code** (TypeScript IDE), **Eclipse** (Java IDE) and **Tomcat Embedded Web Server**.

## Step-by-step guide

1. Download the source files to your local folder(Todo-Angular7-Spring-Boot2-App-master.zip) and unzip them or
GIT clone the source code into your local system
*#git clone https://github.com/ChandanKolambe/Todo-Angular7-Spring-Boot2-App.git*

2. Once the files are mapped, import the project **todo-rest** as a Maven project in Eclipse from unzipped folder "Todo-Angular7-Spring-Boot2-App-master" and import the **frontend/todo** folder in Visual Studio Code.

3. Once successfully imported the project in Eclipse, right-click on the project and click Ëœ**Update Maven**

4. On the pop-up, click "Select All Projects" and also select the "Force update of Snapshots" option and run the **maven update**

This should allow your source to get all the dependent files that are required for a successful completion of the build.
